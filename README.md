# Tracking Particle Events from the CERN Simulated Particle Accelerator Data

This notebook is my work based on the TrackML Kaggle competition (2018), which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/trackml-particle-identification). 

In this project, I explore the data given to us in the competition. I then employ two semi-supervised and two unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict particle tracks made through the detector using given particle hit data.

The data is extensive, with four training folders and one testing folder that can be accessed and downloaded through the Kaggle site. The data is split into events, which represent a simulation of multiple particles released in a particle accelerator. Each event has four CSV files associated with it. The competition provides a TrackML Python library that facilitates the combination of CSV files for an event.

My work in compiled in a Medium article, which can be accessed [here](https://medium.com/@maliarosebarker/tracking-particle-events-from-the-cern-large-hadron-collider-88e5bb2ceea2).
